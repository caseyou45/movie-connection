# Movie Connection
 
Six degrees of Kevin Bacon is a fun game, but dredging your memory for the right actors and films can be hard. This easy-to-use website leverages The Movie Database (TMDb) API to do the hard work for you. Pick your own actors or have them chosen for you. The website will then automatically connect the two actors with the right films and actors. 

On a theoretical level, most people are only a few degrees of separation away from each other. If you had the possibility of knowing the acquaintance of every person you know and those people’s acquaintances ad infinitum, you’d probably be surprised who you’d eventually connect to. The website basically uses cast lists to do the same.  

In brief, the website uses a boatload of GET requests and Promises to get the information it needs. It then searches through the cast list for who it’s looking for. If it does not find who it’s looking for, it then repeats the search with an actor the original actor has worked with. It’s not perfect and may obviously miss an easier connection or come up emptyhanded. But it does work well enough to create surprising answers at times.  

##Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
